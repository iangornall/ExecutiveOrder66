# The group project for Digital Crafts

This project is a simple front end interface to accept a post (a gem) from a user. The gems are stored in firebase, and retrieved and displayed by to the visitor.

We make use of googlemaps and google search to find  a map of your gem, and hopefully a photo too.

This is just a group project for school, so don't try to run it.
